    <h2>About This Application</h2>
    <p>
      This Cloud Test Application was built with Spring Boot, MySQL, Thymeleaf, and Bootstrap.
      It demonstrates CRUD operations, modular architecture, and cloud readiness.

    <p>
      The goal is to provide a simple, maintainable app that can be deployed to cloud platforms
      like Microsoft Azure for validation and testing.
